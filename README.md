# Manim-Pac-Man
Pac-Man: a game built using MANIM python library

Yesterday I watched this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeXBLPC1tns) from Benjamin Hackl and I could not believe that someone (I don't know who) created MANIM interactivity, i.e, you can trigger specific MANIM animations by pressing the mouse/keyboard. 

Obviously the main consequence of it is that we can create games using MANIM! 

In case you want to play my `Pac-Man` game, open the terminal and run `python run_game.py`.

Step by step:
1) Open a terminal and type: `git clone https://github.com/FilipeMarch/Manim-Pac-Man`
2) Open `Manim-Pac-Man` folder on your terminal by typing `cd Manim-Pac-Man`
3) Type `python run_game.py`; The game will start.
