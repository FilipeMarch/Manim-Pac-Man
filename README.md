# Manim-Pac-Man
Pac-Man: a game built using MANIM python library

Yesterday I watched this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeXBLPC1tns) from Benjamin Hackl and I could not believe that someone (I don't know who) created MANIM interactivity, i.e, you can trigger specific MANIM animations by pressing the mouse/keyboard. 

Obviously the main consequence of it is that we can create games using MANIM! 

In case you want to play my `Pac-Man` game, open the terminal and run `python run_game.py`.
